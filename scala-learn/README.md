### S-99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems

#### Several branch conventions
- **master** branch should contains only description of problem
- **dev/${PROBLEM_NAME}** - should contain solution

Those mini projects was taken from [aperiodic](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/)

Problems difficulty
- *`   easy
- **  intermediate
- *** difficult

Your goal should be to find the most elegant solution of the given problems. Efficiency is important, but clarity is even more crucial. 
Some of the (easy) problems can be trivially solved using built-in functions. However, in these cases, you learn more if you try to find your own solution.

#### Working with lists
In many cases, there's more than one reasonable approach. The files linked here may include multiple solutions, with all but one commented out. 
They'll also indicate whether there's a builtin method in Scala that accomplishes the task.

#### Arithmetic
For the next section, we're going to take a different tack with the solutions. We'll declare a new class, S99Int, and an implicit conversion from regular Ints. 
The arithmetic1 file contains the starting definitions for this section. Each individual solution will show the relevant additions to the S99Int class.

#### Binary Trees
A binary tree is either empty or it is composed of a root element and two successors, which are binary trees themselves.

#### Graphs
A graph is defined as a set of nodes and a set of edges, where each edge is a pair of nodes.
